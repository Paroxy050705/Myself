                The pivotal role of education is to mould human lives. Since its inception in 1860 Holy Family Girls’ High School (H.S), Krishnagar has been providing a platform for the young minds to discover a new facet of their personality, to groom their lives based on God consciousness, right values, mutual respect and love. We foster a climate for academic excellence and are committed wholeheartedly to the personal growth and development of our students so that they would become agents of change for a just society. Our education is essentially an “Education of the heart” as lived and upheld by ‘Sisters of Charity of Sts Bartolomea Capitanio and Vincenza Gerosa who run this institution after the example of their Foundress St. Bartolomea Capitanio who held the ‘Youth dear to her heart.’ True to the motto of the school – ‘Good to Great’, we strive to conquer greater heights in pursuit of knowledge and on the process we try to grow humane doing good to our neighbours and allowing the light of Christ shine bright in our lives.

Today’s education is no longer the work of the school alone but it’s a partnership between parents and school. So with the collaborative efforts of management, staff, students and parents, our students grow and flourish as dynamic personalities. A wide range of curricular and co curricular activities are offered for students so that they may foster faith in their own capabilities and may attain full potential. We also take pride in the holistic and innovative learning methods which have helped us to raise the bar in the field of education. The school follows a well researched curriculum that is based on the play way method of learning. As we carry out this awesome and challenging responsibility we are convinced that in Holy Family Girls’ High School (H.S) we will be forming well adjusted – adults ready to face the challenges of life as they leave the school.
Holy Family Girls High School (H.S) had a very humble beginning in the year 1860 by the Society of Sisters of Charity of Sts. Bartolomea Capitanio and Vincenza Gerosa following the examples laid down by Our Lord Jesus Christ. The School which is situated opposite to Krishnagar Stadium and Administrative Building has rendered its selfless service to the people of Krishnagar for the past 160 years.

We have roll strength of 1330 students from classes V to classes XII. The school offers Arts and Science Streams for the students of Higher Secondary. It is totally a Christian Minority School.
